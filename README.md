## Scheduling Notation

This project uses the standard **three-field notation** $\alpha \mid \beta \mid \gamma$ introduced by Graham et al. (1979):

| Field | Meaning | Examples |
|-------|---------|---------|
| $\alpha$ | Machine environment | $1$ (single), $P_m$ (parallel identical), $F_m$ (flow shop), $J_m$ (job shop) |
| $\beta$ | Job characteristics & constraints | $r_j$ (release dates), $p_{ij}$ (machine-dependent), $prec$ (precedence) |
| $\gamma$ | Objective function | $C_{\max}$ (makespan), $\sum C_j$ (total completion), $\sum w_j T_j$ (weighted tardiness) |

---

## Languages

- **Python** — primary implementation language (all problems)
- **C++** — performance-critical algorithms (selected problems)
- **GAMS** — mathematical programming formulations (LP/MILP models)
